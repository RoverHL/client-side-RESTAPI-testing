## Testing Our REST API with Client-side Javascript
These files provide an example of using Javascript to test our REST API. It's similar to the code used in course video 9.5.

You should not simply change it to support your API endpoints and submit it as part of Assignment #5.

You may learn from this example and adapt its ideas to your own application. Either learn from its ideas and then write your own solution, or adapt this one and be sure your solution *adds value* of your own to what it does.
